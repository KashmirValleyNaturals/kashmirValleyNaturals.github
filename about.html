    Kashmir Valley Naturals was born from a deep respect for the land
    and traditions of Kashmir.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the saffron fields of Pampore to the orchards nestled in the
    Himalayan valleys, our products are sourced directly from farmers
    who have cultivated these lands for generations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each harvest carries the fragrance of the valley, the patience of
    the farmer, and the heritage of a region known for purity and craft.
